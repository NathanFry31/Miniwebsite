		<p>This is the birthplace of the mordern day vacuum. This is the home where it all started. At Hoover. We were built by invation. Our founder <b>W. H. "Boss" Hoover</b> had a vision that the house wife would be able to clean the house without using a dust pan or buy spreading the dust and dirt around by old coventnal vacumms. The journey began with James Murray Spangler who had ashma and was a janator from a school. He had an idea to be able to suck up dust and dirt without it flying everywhere. He then sold his patent to Mr. Hoover a year after the idea became a reality. Mr. Hoover would build six a day in his little leather store. Mr. Hoover teamed up with Henry Dreyfuss in 1930 to update hoovers line of products. What he created was the first modern vacuum which would be known as the Model 150 vacuum cleaner.We have since grown all over the world to places like Canada, Europe, Asia and Austrila and to think that this started all in North Canton, Ohio on June 2, 1908. 108 years ago today.</p>
